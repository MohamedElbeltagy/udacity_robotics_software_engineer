In this project, slam gmapping package is used for mapping the working space and the final map
is provided in the map directory. 

For localization, the AMCL package is used to localize the robot relative to the early created 
map from the gmapping package. 

The robot perform pick up and drop off for a virtual object in which the robot is commanded to 
autonomously move to the pick up area to pick up virtual object shown as a yellow square in Rviz 
software.  

The add_markers package node generates the virtual object in Rviz then the pick_objects package
command the robot to go the location of the pick-up and drop-off zones by sending x and y 
coordinates.

To see the whole scenario in action, run ./home_service.sh script in the scripts dirctory.
